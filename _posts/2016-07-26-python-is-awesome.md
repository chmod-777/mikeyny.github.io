Python is a multi-purpose ,high level ,object oriented programming language which can be used to build just about anything given its vast number of tools and libraries.
Its applications included but are not limited to backend web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing.Many developers have also used Python to build productivity tools, games, and desktop apps, so there are plenty of resources to help you learn how to do those as well. Python is ranked as the 4th most popular language by IEEE ,trailing only the classics such as c, c++ and java ,and it is also the number 1 introductory teaching language in U.S. universities ,being taught at instituions such as M.I.T.

Python features simple syntax making it easy to read and learn. Python requires less time, less lines of code, and less concepts to be taught to reach a given goal. Programming in Python is fun! Fun and frequent success breeds confidence and interest in the student, who is then better placed to continue learning to program. Python is referred to as general purpose, high-level programming language, meaning you can use Python to create essentially any type of program or software. This versatility keeps you interested because you’re developing programs and solutions catered to your interests, rather than getting stuck in the weeds worrying about syntax (things like remembering to add a semicolon at the end of each line)Python is an interpreted programming language, which means you don’t need to bother learning how to compile code. Since there is no compilation step, productivity is increased and the time to edit/test/debug is considerably reduced. Simply download an integrated development environment([Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) being my favourite), write your code, and press “Run”.

### Python for Web Development

Youtube, Instagram, Quora, Mozilla.org ,Google ,Spotify and Reddit - These are just but a few great websites coded in python.Python remains to-date one of the best languages for back-end web development ,facing off against web languages like ruby and PHP. Python has many great frameworks and libraries to help you build for the web including:

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.

[Flask](flask.pocoo.org/), a modern, lightweight, well-documented microframework based on Werkzeug and Jinja 2

[Requests](docs.python-requests.org/), a powerful HTTP client library.

[BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), an HTML parser that can handle all sorts of oddball HTML

### Python for Big Data

Nowadays, the data science field is hot, and it is unlikely that this will change in the near future. While a data driven approach is finding its way into all facets of business, companies are fiercely fighting for the best data analytic skills that are available in the market, and salaries for data science roles are going in overdrive. Whether you want to become a Data Analyist ,Data Scientist ,Data Engineer or Data and Analyst Manager mastery of python remains a formiddable skill most employers are looking for.Python offers a variety of libraries for data analysis such as :

[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/),Python Data Analysis Library

[Numpy](www.numpy.org),fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

[Scipy](www.scipy.org),Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering

[Ipython](http://ipython.org/),Enhanced Interactive computing

### Python for Machine Learning

Python is a popular scientific language and a rising star for machine learning. Its great for feature extraction, feature selection, parameter tweaking, backtesting, modelling and classification. It also has some of the industry's best ML libaries:

[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org),Machine Learning in Python

[Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/), A Frameework for fast computation of mathematical expression

[Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org),Deep learning framework by the BVLC

### Python for Task Automation

Among all its other strengths ,python is also a great scripting language. One can use it to automate daily tasks ,undertake batch processing jobs and the occassional tediously boring assignment. Early this year a reddit FiletOfFish1066 user claimed he got fired after it was discovered he had automated his job for the past 6 years and spent his days playing games at work while getting full pay. Coder or non-coder , its is always helpful to know how to [Automate the Boring stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
