As the title implies this is my very first blog post , ever.I struggled on getting somthing to talk about ,so i thought i would introduce myself.

My name is Michael Nyamande ,I'm a 20 year old techie living in Chiredzi ,Zimbabwe.

I love **programming** , so far i've learned .

1. C 

2. Visual Basic 

3. Java
  * Android Programming

4. Python
  * Basics
  * Using external modules(BeatifulSoup,Fuzzywuzzy ,etc)
  * Django(Build a simple blogging app)

5. Web Development
   * HTML
   * CSS
     * FOUNDATION
     * SASS
   * JAVASCRIPT
      * JQUERY
   * JEKYLL(created this site)


and i'm not going to stop there ,i always try to empower myself by learning new things.I'm constantly browsing the web looking for new technologies,
as a consequence i easily get distracted and dont get much done ,but i try. I create this blog as a way to try and document my work ,i'll be posting weekly updates 
of my escapadess in tech ,aswell as some tutorials whenever i learn something cool ,i think i should share.
